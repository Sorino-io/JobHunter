# Project Structure Plan for Open-Source Job Application Automation Tool

# Project Overview

# The goal is to create an open-source tool that automates job applications by leveraging AI agents, browser automation, and external APIs (e.g., Google or Grok). The system will use FastAPI for the backend, Vue with TypeScript for the frontend, and a pnpm workspaces monorepo for modular development. The tool will scrape job listings, use AI to tailor applications, and automate form submissions via browser control, ensuring scalability, modularity, and community-driven development.

# Monorepo Structure

# A pnpm workspaces monorepo will organize the project into distinct packages for backend, frontend, shared utilities, and AI agents, enabling modular development and dependency management.

- **Root Directory**: `/job-application-automation-tool`
  - `packages/`
    - `backend/` - FastAPI-based backend for API services and job application logic
    - `frontend/` - Vue.js with TypeScript for the user interface
    - `shared/` - Shared utilities, types, and configurations
    - `ai-agents/` - AI agent logic for processing job data and generating applications
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Defines workspace packages
  - `package.json` - Root-level dependencies and scripts
  - `.gitignore` - Ignore node_modules, build artifacts, etc.
  - `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
  - `LICENSE` - Open-source license (e.g., MIT)
  - `turbo.json` (optional) - For Turborepo to optimize build and test workflows

  - `README.md` - Documentation for shared utilities

# 4. AI Agents (`packages/ai-agents/`)

# Handles AI-driven tasks, such as job description analysis, resume tailoring, and cover letter generation, using APIs like Grok or Google.

- **Structure**:
  - `src/`
    - `agents/` - AI agent implementations
      - `job-analyzer/` - Analyzes job descriptions for keywords and requirements

# Development Workflow

- **Monorepo Management**: Use pnpm workspaces for dependency management and shared packages. Optionally, use Turborepo for caching and parallel task execution.
- **Version Control**: Use Git with a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or trunk-based development). Host on GitHub for open-source collaboration.
- **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and deployment. Build and deploy backend and frontend as Docker containers.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests (backend: pytest, frontend: Vitest) and integration tests. Include end-to-end tests for critical workflows (e.g., job application submission).
- **Documentation**: Maintain a `README.md` in each package and the root directory. Use tools like Sphinx or VitePress for API and user documentation.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for contributions, code style, and pull request processes.

# External Integrations

- **Browser Automation**: Use Playwright or Puppeteer for scraping job listings and automating form submissions on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.
- **AI APIs**:
  - **Grok API**: For AI-driven text generation (e.g., cover letters, resume tailoring). Refer to https://x.ai/api for setup.
  - **Google APIs**: For job search (e.g., Google Jobs API) or NLP tasks (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language).
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 for user authentication and API access (e.g., Google, LinkedIn).
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, job data, and application history. Integrate with SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM.
- **Vector Database** (optional): Use Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search of job listings if RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is implemented.

Deployment

- **Backend**: Deploy FastAPI on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean) using Docker and a WSGI server like Gunicorn with Uvicorn.
- **Frontend**: Deploy Vue.js app via Vite, hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or as a static site with Nginx.
- **Infrastructure**: Use Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes for production scalability.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate logging (e.g., Loguru) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for observability.

# Security and Compliance

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data (e.g., resumes, personal info) is encrypted and complies with GDPR/CCPA.
- **API Security**: Use environment variables for API keys and implement rate-limiting and authentication for external APIs.
- **Browser Automation**: Handle anti-bot measures (e.g., CAPTCHAs) ethically, respecting platform terms of service.

# Community and Maintenance

- **Open-Source Practices**: Encourage contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests. Maintain a changelog and release notes.
- **Modularity**: Design components to be reusable and extensible for future features (e.g., multi-platform support, additional AI models).
- **Documentation**: Provide clear setup instructions, API documentation, and examples for developers and users.

# Next Steps

1. Initialize the monorepo with pnpm and set up workspace configuration.
2. Scaffold backend with FastAPI and frontend with Vue/TypeScript.
3. Implement basic browser automation for job scraping and form submission.
4. Integrate AI APIs (Grok or Google) for job analysis and application generation.
5. Set up CI/CD and documentation for community contributions.
