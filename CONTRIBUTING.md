```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scopes

- **frontend**: Vue.js frontend application
- **backend**: FastAPI backend application
- **ai-agents**: AI processing and agents
- **shared**: Shared utilities and types
- **deps**: Dependency updates
- **config**: Configuration changes
- **docker**: Docker-related changes
- **docs**: Documentation changes

### Examples

```bash
# Good examples
